### Deep Learning Based GEC in Non-Standard Russian

This repository is dedicated to the research work titled "Deep Learning Based GEC in Non-Standard Russian" by Arina Zamyshevskaya. 
The study focuses on correcting grammatical errors made by non-native Russian speakers using advanced language models. 
It explores the use of the Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5) and ruGPT-3 with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) 
to improve error correction. The research highlights the effectiveness of these models in addressing specific grammatical 
and proposes new methods for further enhancement in handling a broader range of errors.
